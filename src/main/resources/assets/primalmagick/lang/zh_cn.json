On the other hand, it seems... limited.<BR>I mean, let's be honest here, it's a stick with some magick dust rubbed into its grain.  It can't hold much mana, and it only reacts with a very few things.  I can't even cast spells with it!<BR>I'm never going to become a real mage unless I get myself a better wand.",
  "research.primalmagick.advanced_wandmaking.text.stage.2": "Okay, I've thought about this a lot, and I'm certain that it's possible for me to make a better wand than what I have now.  After studying my Grimoire, I've concluded that my next wand needs to be made of multiple parts.<BR>First, it needs a body, a core.  I need something to hold on to, after all.  And that core has to be more receptive to magick than a simple stick.<BR>Second, I need a better way to channel mana into and out of the wand.  A pair of metal caps, maybe.<BR>Third, it needs a structure to actually hold all of the mana that I want to channel.  Something a little ostentatious, maybe, like a small gem.<BR>Each of those parts will require more research individually.  But in the meantime, I've put together a design for a table where I can assemble those parts once I have them.",

Permanent attunement comes from learning new secrets, and temporary comes from channeling mana.<BR>Both of these have drawbacks, however.  Secrets take a long time to learn for permanent attunement, and there are only so many of them out there.  And temporary attunement is just that: temporary.  I must continue channeling mana of that source, or that attunement will fade.<BR>I wonder if there's another method with which I can induce an attunement to a source?",
  "research.primalmagick.ambrosia.text.stage.2": "So this is why the Grimoire was hinting at me about Manafruit.  It's the key to my attunement!<BR>By performing the right ritual, I can transform Manafruit into a substance I've come to call Ambrosia.  Eating ambrosia will induce a small amount of attunement within me to the source with which it's aligned.<BR>There are two limits to ambrosia that I've been able to determine.  First, I can only induce a small amount of attunement using it; beyond that it just won't work.  And second, attuning myself to one source will de-attune me to all of the others to a lesser degree.<BR>Still, this may be the secret to unlocking greater levels of primal attunement for myself!",

Behold, the Arcanometer!<BR>Rather than spending an afternoon hunched over an analysis table, I can simply take the Arcanometer, point it at a block, and trigger it.  Presto, one detailed scan result.<BR>I can even use it to scan creatures now!  For obvious reasons, they'd never let me take them apart under a magnifying glass, but now I don't have to.

Then you stage everything in the right place.  And then you follow each step exactly as written at the appointed time.<BR>There's just a slightly higher chance of something exploding if you do it wrong.<BR>I need several things in order to conduct a ritual.  First and most important is the central altar.  This serves as the focal point of the ritual, around which everything else is arrayed, both physically and metaphysically.<BR>Next come the offering pedestals, arrayed around the altar.  It's on these that I place the ingredients for the ritual.  Having more pedestals than I need doesn't hurt, but they might get a little in the way.<BR>Thirdly, all rituals require props of some kind, placed near the altar.  I'll come back to these in a bit.<BR>Finally, I need refined salt, and lots of it.  Every block that's part of the ritual, be it a prop or an offering pedestal, must be connected to the central altar by an unbroken line of salt.  No salt, no mystical connection, bad times.<BR>To start a ritual, I must first identify what ingredients and props it needs.  These will be listed in the Grimoire entry for each ritual.  Once identified, I array the pedestals and props around the altar, ensuring a salt connection.  Symmetry is important in this placement, and will contribute to a successful ritual.  I then place each of the ingredients on a separate pedestal and, once I'm ready to begin, wave my wand at the central altar.<BR>Once started, an orb of energy will appear above the altar.  This orb is a sort of status indicator for the ritual's stability.<BR>Right, stability.<BR>Ritual magick is dangerous, and rituals destabilize the longer they go on.  Too much instability buildup, and mishaps can happen.  That's bad, potentially disastrous.  The more red that orb over the altar is, the more unstable the ritual has become.  On the other hand, if it turns green, that means I'm doing a good job keeping the instability in check.  All rituals will destabilize over time proportionately to their instability rating, but other things can affect it as well.  The symmetry that I mentioned earlier?  Asymmetrical ritual setups will destabilize faster.  Using too much salt will also cause destabilization, as it grounds out the magick.<BR>Anyway, as the ritual progresses, the central altar will absorb the offerings I've placed on the pedestals.  At certain points, though, the ritual will pause and demand that I interact with one of the ritual's props.  This is the most dangerous time in a ritual, as instability will be mounting while no progress is being made.  Once the prop interaction is complete, the ritual will resume progress, with an added burst of stability.  Precisely how I need to interact with a prop will be detailed in its Grimoire entry.<BR>Once all of the offerings have been absorbed and all of the props have been interacted with, the ritual will end and the end result will appear on the central altar for me to claim.<BR>Should I feel at any point that a ritual is spiraling beyond my control, I can abort the ritual by waving my wand at the altar a second time.  This may have consequences, depending on the built-up instability, but that's better than letting it continue indefinitely.",

That alone makes it worth studying.<BR>Second, I have full control of the enchantment that gets applied.  No more praying for the right random result at the enchanting table.<BR>And third, I can actually apply runes to an item that I've already enchanted for further effect.<BR>This process has its drawbacks, though.  These runes are very complicated; I'm going to have to research each of them individually to make sure I get them right.  And an item can only have one set of runes applied to it at a time.  Finally, and most strangely, while a standard grindstone will remove the magick that the runes impart, it won't remove the runes themselves, so I can't apply new ones.<BR>Still, this is a discipline that seems well worth my time to pursue, if I want to give myself the arms and armor I need to survive.",

I've learned how to freeze my visualization of a spell in my mind, and then capture that vision in written form on a scroll.  I can then take that scroll, speak a simple word of power, and unleash those energies on demand.  The scroll will be consumed, but that's a small price to pay.<BR>As for what kind of spell to cast, I decided to first go with an incantation with which to defend myself.  By channeling Earth mana, I can create a damaging burst of energy that will also propel the target away from me.  Curiously, players like myself seem very resistant to sorcerous attacks, taking only half as much damage as another creature would.<BR>So far, the range of my spells is limited to what I can touch, which isn't ideal, but will do for now.  I can also channel the energy of a spell through my own body, but obviously that's not a great idea to use with a damaging spell like this.<BR>To create a spell, I'll need to use a Spellcrafting Altar like the one I've just designed.  Placing a blank spell scroll on the altar, I'll be able to select what vehicle the spell should take (e.g. a Touch spell) and what payload it should carry (e.g. Earth damage).  I suspect I'll also be able to select ways to modify the spell once I learn more, but for now that's it.<BR>Once the characteristics of the spell are settled, I will have to take a wand, place it on the altar, and use it to spend mana to scribe the spell onto a scroll.<BR>I suspect there are a wide variety of types of spells I'll be able to cast with more experience, so I'd better get practicing!",
