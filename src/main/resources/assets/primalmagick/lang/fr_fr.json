  "research.primalmagick.basic_ritual.text.stage.1": "I think I'm starting to get the hang of Ritual Magick.  It's like cooking a recipe.<BR>First, you assemble your ingredients.  Then you stage everything in the right place.  And then you follow each step exactly as written at the appointed time.<BR>There's just a slightly higher chance of something exploding if you do it wrong.<BR>I need several things in order to conduct a ritual.  First and most important is the central altar.  This serves as the focal point of the ritual, around which everything else is arrayed, both physically and metaphysically.<BR>Next come the offering pedestals, arrayed around the altar.  It's on these that I place the ingredients for the ritual.  Having more pedestals than I need doesn't hurt, but they might get a little in the way.<BR>Thirdly, all rituals require props of some kind, placed near the altar.  I'll come back to these in a bit.<BR>Finally, I need refined salt, and lots of it.  Every block that's part of the ritual, be it a prop or an offering pedestal, must be connected to the central altar by an unbroken line of salt.  No salt, no mystical connection, bad times.<BR>To start a ritual, I must first identify what ingredients and props it needs.  These will be listed in the Grimoire entry for each ritual.  Once identified, I array the pedestals and props around the altar, ensuring a salt connection.  Symmetry is important in this placement, and will contribute to a successful ritual.  I then place each of the ingredients on a separate pedestal and, once I'm ready to begin, wave my wand at the central altar.<BR>Once started, an orb of energy will appear above the altar.  This orb is a sort of status indicator for the ritual's stability.<BR>Right, stability.<BR>Ritual magick is dangerous, and rituals destabilize the longer they go on.  Too much instability buildup, and mishaps can happen.  That's bad, potentially disastrous.  The more red that orb over the altar is, the more unstable the ritual has become.  On the other hand, if it turns green, that means I'm doing a good job keeping the instability in check.  All rituals will destabilize over time proportionately to their instability rating, but other things can affect it as well.  The symmetry that I mentioned earlier?  Asymmetrical ritual setups will destabilize faster.  Using too much salt will also cause destabilization, as it grounds out the magick.<BR>Anyway, as the ritual progresses, the central altar will absorb the offerings I've placed on the pedestals.  At certain points, though, the ritual will pause and demand that I interact with one of the ritual's props.  This is the most dangerous time in a ritual, as instability will be mounting while no progress is being made.  Once the prop interaction is complete, the ritual will resume progress, with an added burst of stability.  Precisely how I need to interact with a prop will be detailed in its Grimoire entry.<BR>Once all of the offerings have been absorbed and all of the props have been interacted with, the ritual will end and the end result will appear on the central altar for me to claim.<BR>Should I feel at any point that a ritual is spiraling beyond my control, I can abort the ritual by waving my wand at the altar a second time.  This may have consequences, depending on the built-up instability, but that's better than letting it continue indefinitely.",

By carving them into stone, then inscribing the right combination of them onto an item, I can imbue that item with an effect much like an enchantment.<BR>While somewhat invovled, there appear to be a number of benefits to this process over using an enchanting table.<BR>First, it doesn't cost me any of my hard-won experience.  That alone makes it worth studying.<BR>Second, I have full control of the enchantment that gets applied.  No more praying for the right random result at the enchanting table.<BR>And third, I can actually apply runes to an item that I've already enchanted for further effect.<BR>This process has its drawbacks, though.  These runes are very complicated; I'm going to have to research each of them individually to make sure I get them right.  And an item can only have one set of runes applied to it at a time.  Finally, and most strangely, while a standard grindstone will remove the magick that the runes impart, it won't remove the runes themselves, so I can't apply new ones.<BR>Still, this is a discipline that seems well worth my time to pursue, if I want to give myself the arms and armor I need to survive.",

It's all about visualizing the effect one wants to see, shaping mana to fit that form, and then unleashing it.  The bad news is that casting a spell through pure force of will has so far proven impossible.<BR>Fortunately, I have tools to work with.  I've learned how to freeze my visualization of a spell in my mind, and then capture that vision in written form on a scroll.  I can then take that scroll, speak a simple word of power, and unleash those energies on demand.  The scroll will be consumed, but that's a small price to pay.<BR>As for what kind of spell to cast, I decided to first go with an incantation with which to defend myself.  By channeling Earth mana, I can create a damaging burst of energy that will also propel the target away from me.  Curiously, players like myself seem very resistant to sorcerous attacks, taking only half as much damage as another creature would.<BR>So far, the range of my spells is limited to what I can touch, which isn't ideal, but will do for now.  I can also channel the energy of a spell through my own body, but obviously that's not a great idea to use with a damaging spell like this.<BR>To create a spell, I'll need to use a Spellcrafting Altar like the one I've just designed.  Placing a blank spell scroll on the altar, I'll be able to select what vehicle the spell should take (e.g. a Touch spell) and what payload it should carry (e.g. Earth damage).  I suspect I'll also be able to select ways to modify the spell once I learn more, but for now that's it.<BR>Once the characteristics of the spell are settled, I will have to take a wand, place it on the altar, and use it to spend mana to scribe the spell onto a scroll.<BR>I suspect there are a wide variety of types of spells I'll be able to cast with more experience, so I'd better get practicing!",

  "research.primalmagick.first_steps.text.stage.1": "What an incredible book!  While largely blank, it seems to contain more pages than could conceivably fit in its slim binding.  Plus, it generates its own updating index as I write in it.  This will make a perfect volume in which to record my progress in magickal studies.<BR>Note, however, that I said, 'largely blank'.  Sometimes when I flip randomly through its pages, I find one covered in strange notes and diagrams, a page that seems to disappear once I turn past it.  I can't understand most of their contents, but I can eke out a few hints of how to proceed in my studies, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading me to vast knowledge.<BR>So far, the first thing I've learned that the strange dust I found under the shrine is called Essence, and that it's a physical manifestation of magickal energy, called Mana.  The magickal arts rely heavily on Essence and Mana, so I should be prepared to seek out as much as I can.<BR>The second thing I've learned, after much frustration, is that magickal crafting requires techniques, and frequently infusions of Mana, that are beyond the capacity of a normal crafting table.  I'll need to devise a new type of workbench if I'm to progress further, but curiously the Grimoire gives no suggestion as to how I might do that.  Perhaps it's a test, of sorts.<BR>I wonder...  Waving a wand at a bookshelf was enough to get me this Grimoire.  Maybe waving it at a crafting table will get me what I need a second time?",

  "research.primalmagick.first_steps.text.stage.3": "I've now got some mana and an arcane workbench with which to use it.  Now the question is what to do with them.<BR>The notes that I find in the grimoire make mention of five primal sources of magick: the Earth, the Sea, the Sky, the Sun, and the Moon.  It also hints that everything in the world, down to the smallest pebble, has an affinity to one or more of these sources.  That seems worth investigating, but I'll need better tools.<BR>It shouldn't take much to get me started.  A sturdy wooden table to work at, a magnifying glass to more closely study objects, and some paper on which to record my findings.  Yes, that'll do for now.<BR>Once I get that all set up, I can start analyzing things.  I expect that the analysis process will have to be quite thorough for me to learn anything, though.<BR>It would probably be best to hold off on analyzing anything truly valuable, as the item will undoubtedly be lost beyond repair after I'm done with it.

Granted, I'm not sure what to do with this information yet, but I'm certain it will prove valuable down the road.

  "written_book.primalmagick.dream_journal.text": "I dreamed of the shrine last night. The same strange energy still permeated the air, but this time I knew the word for it.\n\nMagick.\n\nAs if the word unlocked something in my mind, I knew what to do. In the dream, I dug beneath the base of the shrine and found stone laced with a curious dust. Sensing more magick within it, I took a handful of the dust and rubbed it onto an ordinary stick.\n\nSo imbued, the stick became something more. In the dream, I took it and waved it at a bookcase. The dream ended before I could see what resulted, but I feel like it would have been something wondrous.\n\nI feel like this could be a key to something amazing, if I just have the courage to take that first step.",
